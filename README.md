                height={150}

## **Responsive**

The component can be made responsive using *vw* or *rem* or any other unit you want to use.

```javascript
    unit={"unit"}
```

Using **vw** will make the componenet shift size according to view port width.

When using **rem** you would have to define rem values for different viewport widths in css. You can search more about how rem works on google.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 600px) {
  .root {
      font-size: 8px;
    }
}
```
